# README #

I have made a query box in which any username can be entered and his details along with list of repositories will show.And when any of those repos are clicked,it fulfills the 3 basic user stories to rank the developer by contributions to a repo,by no.of followers,by no. of repos and gists.

### What is this repository for? ###

This app uses Github API to fetch user and his repositories data, and rank repositories contributors and show them in one list to fulfill following user stories:

● The rank should be filterable by amount of contributions made by developer to all Angular repositories, by amount of followers, public repos & gists he/she published.

● We should be able to view the details page of each contributor with all repositories he contributed to and his details.

● We should be able to navigate to repository details page where we can find other contributors. 

### How do I get set up? ###

* Deployment instructions: Just download Github.css,Github.js and index.html files and run in any browser.
